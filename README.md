# Interacive Dashboard: Fast-food Nutritional Data

## Project Members: Kathy Manthey, Manuela Mu√±oz, Nicole Muscanell

## Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to develop an interactive dashboard displaying visualizations of nutrition information for several national (U.S.) fast food chains: McDonalds, Subway, and Starbucks. The dashboard will allow users to explore both the macro and micro-nutritional content of specific menu items at the three food chains. Further, users will be able to interact with the visualizations by choosing menu items of interest based on restaurant and food category. While users will also be able to explore very specific aspects of the data (at the menu item level), there will also be a few visualizations that present aggregate data, e.g., averages of nutrition information based on restaurant and food category.
